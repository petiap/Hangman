  1. Refactor the code
    - basic refactoring - DONE
    - debugging - DONE
    - implement missing functionality - DONE
    - test for compliance with the specification - DONE
  2. Write Unit Tests
    - add unit tests for the existing classes - DONE
  3. Implement Data Patterns
    - implement 2 Creational patterns - DONE
        - implemented Singleton pattern
        - implemented Lazy-Initialization pattern
        Note: The combination of Singleton and Lazy-Initialization patterns
              is a pattern known as Initialization-on-Demand Holder Idiom
              (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization-on-demand_holder_idiom),
              which effectively results in a thread-safe lazy singleton initialization              
    - implement 2 Structural patterns
    - implement 2 Behavioral patterns
        - implemented State pattern
  4. Documentation
    - detailed step-by-step description of th erefactoring process
